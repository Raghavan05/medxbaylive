                <li>Business Associate Agreements: MedxBay operates under Business Associate Agreements with healthcare providers, ensuring that all use and disclosure of your PHI comply with HIPAA regulations. These agreements mandate that we protect your PHI and use it solely for permitted purposes.</li>

To exercise these rights, you must contact your healthcare provider directly. MedxBay facilitates the scheduling process, but the management of PHI rights remains with the healthcare provider.</li>
                <li>Restrictions and Termination: You may request restrictions on the use and disclosure of your PHI through your healthcare provider. MedxBay will continue to use and disclose your PHI in accordance with our Business Associate Agreement until any such agreement is terminated.

              <b>4. Choices Relating to Interest-Based Advertising Related to Cookies</b><br />
              MedxBay collaborates with third-party network advertisers to serve ads on the Site and manage advertising on other websites.
